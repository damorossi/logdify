# Getting Started with Logdify App

This project was created by npx.

I would have made more tests, and used redux, I believe it would have been much easeier to work with data wi so many calculations. 
I indexed the data, to have some control of it.
I hope you enjoy it!

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\

You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn  test`
Will display few tests that I have made
